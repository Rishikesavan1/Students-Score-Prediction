# Students-Score-Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression task to predict a student's score based on the number of study hours. It involves using a dataset, performing linear regression, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about the number of study hours and the corresponding scores for a group of students.

Dataset: [Student_scores.csv](http://bit.ly/w-data)

## Project Structure

- `Students_Scores_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook or Python script showcasing the step-by-step process of loading the data, visualizing it, performing linear regression, and evaluating the model.
- `Student_Scores.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if using the provided .ipynb file)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open and run the `Students_Scores_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python script.
